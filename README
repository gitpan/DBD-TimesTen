**** NOTICE ******** NOTICE ******** NOTICE ******** NOTICE ******** NOTICE ****

   This is a BETA version of the driver, since I am not actively using TimesTen
   I have not encountered every issue.  This driver is based on DBD::ODBC,
   since the TimesTen client can be directly linked to any ODBC-based
   application.  The intent is to eventually code all of the TimesTen
   extensions into this driver.

**** NOTICE ******** NOTICE ******** NOTICE ******** NOTICE ******** NOTICE ****


INTRODUCTION:
   This driver is based on DBD::ODBC 1.13.  Thanks to Tim Bunce, Jeff Urlwin,
   and the contributors of DBD::ODBC, as they have made this driver fairly
   easy to implement with TimesTen.

   There is more work to be done here, it appears the bulk inserts need to
   be done and probably a bunch of other things.


*BEFORE* BUILDING, TESTING AND INSTALLING this you will need to:

    Build, test and install Perl 5 (as per DBI specifications/compatibility)
    It is very important to TEST it and INSTALL it!

    Build, test and install the DBI module (at least DBI 1.201).
    It is very important to TEST it and INSTALL it!

    Remember to *read* the DBI README file!

    Remember to *read* the DBD::TimesTen.pm POD documentation!


BUILDING:

  set-up these environment variables:
    DBI_DSN   The dbi data source, e.g. 'dbi:TimesTen:YOUR_DSN_HERE'
    DBI_USER  The username to use to connect to the database
    DBI_PASS  The username to use to connect to the database
    TT_HOME   (Unix only) The dir your driver manager is installed in
  perl Makefile.PL
  make                (or nmake, if VC++ on Win32)
  make test           (or nmake, if VC++ on Win32)

TESTING
  
  make test
  make test TEST_VERBOSE=1   (if any of the t/* tests fail)
  make install               (if the tests look okay)


IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:

Do not hand edit the generated Makefile unless you are completely sure
you understand the implications! Always try to make changes via the
Makefile.PL command line and/or editing the Makefile.PL.

You should not need to make any changes. If you do *please* let me
know so that I can try to make it automatic in a later release.

Please post details of any problems (or changes you needed to make) to
chad.wagner@gmail.com. But note...

** IT IS IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:

1. A complete log of a all steps of the build, e.g.:

  perl Makefile.PL           (do a make realclean first)
  make
  make test
  make test TEST_VERBOSE=1   (if any tests fail)

2. Full details of which software you are using, including:

  Perl version (the output of perl -V)

3. A repeatable test case, including:

  Tables
  Data
  Perl code

It is important to check that you are using the latest version before
posting.
